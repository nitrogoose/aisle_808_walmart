# aisle_808_walmart

Overview:
We present a Flutter-based smart shopping app designed for a seamless in-store experience at Walmart. The app allows customers to browse, add items to cart, apply dynamic discount coupons, and pay â€” all from their phones. Upon successful payment, a unique QR code is generated, which can be scanned at the Walmart kiosk checkpoint for instant, hassle-free pickup.

Key Features:

 Cross-platform App: Built with Flutter for a smooth and responsive shopping experience on both Android and iOS.

 Instant QR Code Generation: After payment, users receive a unique QR code linked to their order.

 Smart Checkout & Pickup: Scan the QR at a kiosk to quickly verify and collect items, reducing wait time and crowding.

 Flask Backend: A lightweight and efficient backend that handles user orders, processes payments, and updates inventory in real-time.

 Dynamic Discount Coupons: Personalized coupon codes are applied per order based on a custom algorithm (e.g., total cart value, frequency of purchase, or seasonal offers).
